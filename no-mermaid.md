# Personalized AI Context Pipeline (Experimental Workflow)

## Overview

This repository outlines an updated implementation plan for an experiment in proactive, user-driven AI personalization.

It provides a novel implementation focused on the **proactive creation and structuring of user context**, offering an alternative to approaches that extract context retrospectively from chat histories. 

While much recent development has centered around context and memory systems, particularly **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** drawing from large enterprise data stores, this project explores how **more nuanced, granular, user-generated context** can be collected and organized.

This document spells out the technical details for building such a system, including the workflow and supporting mechanisms required to make proactive context capture operational.
 

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Context Data Capture

- **Capture Mode**:  
  - User records information about themselves.  
  - Capture can be **user-initiated** or **prompted** (e.g., random question generators or targeted question selection based on existing context gaps).
- **Recommended Recording Guidelines**:  
  - Snippets of around **three minutes** per entry to optimize chunking and retrieval in vector stores.
  - Longer recordings are possible, but granular entries are preferable for searchability.

---

### Phase 2: Speech-to-Text Processing

- **Speech-to-Text System Requirements**:
  - Must support **webhooks**.
  - Must allow users to **tag** context entries to trigger automated workflows.
- **Potential Tools**:
  - [VoiceNotes](https://voicenotes.com)
  - [AudioPen.ai](https://audiopen.ai)

> *Note: If native webhook support for tagged entries is not available, a dedicated account could be created solely for context recording purposes.*

---

### Phase 3: Context Streamlining

- **Initial Processing**:
  - Captured notes are passed to a **text summarization/rewriting assistant**.
  - Purpose: Eliminate redundancy, streamline phrasing, and prepare entries for structured storage.
- **Pipeline Tools**:
  - [Zapier](https://zapier.com)
  - [n8n](https://n8n.io)

---

### Phase 4: Context Storage

- **Storage**:
  - Processed entries are embedded into a **vector database** for later retrieval and use.
- **Potential Future Features**:
  - Ability to **delete** or **edit** past context entries.
  - User settings to control whether to **save**, **discard**, or **tag** notes before sending.

---

### Phase 5: Personalized AI Agent Configuration

- **Deployment**:
  - A single **personalized AI assistant** is connected to the vector database.
  - The assistant leverages the growing context repository to generate **highly personalized responses**.

---

## Advantages of the Workflow

- **Proactive Context Development**: Builds user-specific context *ahead of time*, rather than only mining it from conversations.
- **Customizable**: Users can manage how much data they wish to contribute and refine context over time.
- **Seamless Recording and Storage**: Streamlines data collection into a single, easy-to-use process.

---

## Related Concepts

- **Complementary Use**: This system can be **combined** with retrospective context mining (e.g., chat history summarization) for a hybrid personalization strategy.
- **Granularity**: By maintaining small, thematically coherent context chunks, the system supports efficient vector search and targeted AI personalization.

---

## Implementation Notes

- A working prototype would initially prioritize **simplicity over feature richness**.
- Users can later refine entries manually if needed.
- Extensibility for managing context CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations should be considered in pipeline design.
